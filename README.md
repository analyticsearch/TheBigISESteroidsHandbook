# About The Big ISESteroids Handbook
The Big ISESteroids Handbook is a joint project between Dr. Tobias Weltner and Richard Diphoorn and xxx. The purpose is to opensource the ISESteroids documentation, so that everybody can share their tips and tricks on how to use ISESteroids. As we all know maybe, Tobias is the sole developer on ISESteroids, so he can use any help to make the documentation better. Feel free to fork and contribute to this project!
